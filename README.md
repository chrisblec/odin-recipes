# odin-recipes

2024 is the year that I learn to code. I started in January with Harvard's CS50 and continued with FreeCodeCamp. I have decided to give Odin Project a go to get some experience setting up my local coding environment and trying out everything I learned thus far.

This was a pretty simple exercise for me, as I've gotten pretty comfy with HTML. In fact, I first started using it way back in 1997. Looking forward to more challenges with TOP.
